Greetings! I am a faculty member at Vision & Lanugage Group, Department of Data Science and AI, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University Clayton Campus, Australia. I am ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) Fellow between 2019-2021 (awarded in 2018).

Before joining Monash, I was a Postdoc Research Associate in School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Prof. Alex Hauptmann](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~alex/){:target="_blank"}. I have spent most of my time working on exploring multiple signals (visual, acoustic, textual) for automatic content analysis in unconstrained or surveillence videos. Our system has achieved top performance in various international competitions, such as TRECVID MED, TRECVID SIN, and TRECVID AVS.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, under the supervision of [Prof. Yi Yang](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yiyang/){:target="_blank"}. During my PhD study, I was sequentially mentored by Prof. [Feiping Nie](http://www.escience.cn/people/fpnie/){:target="_blank"} and [Yaoliang Yu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~y328yu/){:target="_blank"}. My research focus in this period was mainly on developing machine learning algorithms and apply them to multimedia analysis and computer vision.

## Research Interests

My general research interest is to develop structured machine learning models for computer vision and multimedia tasks. I mainly investigate how to explore the information contained in videos and develop the advanced artificial intelligence systems. Recently, I focus on the following topics, include:

- Video Analysis, including event detection, object detection, segmentation.

- Learning with Limited Supervision, including few-shot learning, zero-shot learning.

- Visual Navigation, including vision-language navigation, and vision-and-dialog navigation.

## For Prospective Students

I am actively looking for talented and motivated PhD students to work with me. The research topics include multimedia, computer vision and vision-language learning. Monash is ranked: 75th globally in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2020. 73rd globally and third in Australia in ShanghaiRanking's Academic Ranking of World Universities 2019. 21st in the World's Most International Universities in 2017 as released by Times Higher Education.
